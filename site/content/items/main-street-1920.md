## Description

This remarkable photograph captures Main Street at a pivotal moment in the city's history. Taken in 1920, it shows the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles, with several early model cars visible along the street.

## Historical Context

The 1920s marked a period of significant growth and modernization for our city. This photograph documents several important features:

- The three-story brick buildings that still define our downtown architecture
- Early electric street lighting system installed in 1918
- Mix of transportation modes typical of the era
- Thriving commercial district with various storefronts

## Notable Features

Looking closely at the image, several businesses can be identified:
- Morrison's Department Store (left side)
- First National Bank (distinctive columns visible)
- Several smaller shops with canvas awnings

The photograph was taken by Johnson Photo Studio, the premier photography business in the city from 1895 to 1965.
